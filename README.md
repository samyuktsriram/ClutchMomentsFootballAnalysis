# ClutchFactorFootball

The goals of this branch are to create a program that:

1. Accepts a json file for a match's events
2. finds relevent event positions within that file, such as goals, missed one-on-ones
3. returns an object with some form of analysis on the match. (Eg: missed one-on-ones, goals after 80th minute.)
