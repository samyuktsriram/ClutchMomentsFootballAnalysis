The question I wanted to answer with Beta2 was: 
Given a draw-ing scoreline at the 80th minute, what was the quality of goal-scoring chances a team was able to create?
What about from a losing position? How productive was a team's attack in the crucial moments chasing a game?
How did these performances compare to an average team in the same match condition?

The excel file makes this analysis easier, as it can gather all data across the 941 matches. 
It is also easy to filter and reach the exact scoreline scenario that interests you.

Caution: Games that went to penalties have a very high GoalLikelihood for both teams - please keep this in mind when analysing!
These matches can be found by filtering GDat80 to 0, and sorting GoalLikelihood in descending order. 
If a game has a ~0.99 GoalLikelihood for both teams, it can be removed from the data. 
The reason is Statsbomb's dataset counts all the penalties in the shootout as shots with high xG, and the filters applied in this program did not have a way to detect when a game went to penalties. 

You can download the excel file and play around with it. Use filters to set-up the match conditions/teams you are interested in!
