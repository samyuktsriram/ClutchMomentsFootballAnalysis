To run Beta1 for yourself:

  1. Download the code files from the CodeFiles folder.
  2. Download the Statsbomb Open Dataset and place the code inside the main branch. The code should be at the same level as the 'data' folder.
  3. Open FileLooper.py and execute the bottom few lines of code. They've been commented and separated from the rest of the code.
  
 Just ensure that the code is on the same level as the 'data' folder in the Statsbomb Open Database files. 
 You can find the data here: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data
